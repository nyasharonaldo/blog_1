Schwab, with more than$4 trillionin assets, has stepped up its focus on income-related products as it seeks to attract a larger share of the retirement business. Every day, roughly 10,000 Americans turn 65, the traditional retirement age.

“Generating income is one of the greatest financial needs facing the growing number of investors who are in, or preparing for, retirement,” Rick Wurster, executive vice president of Schwab Asset Management Solutions, said in the statement.
